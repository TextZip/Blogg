# Hardware
- ESP32
- 1 Meter WS2812B Strip (144 LEDS per meter density)
- Microphone Module
- SMPS
- RTC Module
- LED Tubelight + holder
- Basic power tools  

# Software
Given that the lightsaber had 144LEDs and each LED is supposed to represent the color of 1 pixel, we needed to scale images to 128x128 pixels before they could be used in the light saber

Since the pivot point of the light saber will be at the bottom center of the image, the side length of the image given its diagonal length is fixed at 144 turns out to be 128 as shown in the figure below.

The current angle of the lightsaber is caliculated using the MPU6050, the corosponding values of the LED colors needed are picked by overlaying a straight line over the image array and extracting the pixels that conincide with the above mentioned imaginary line.
