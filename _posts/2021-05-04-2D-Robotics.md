## Introduction

## Coordinate Transformation in 2D
The motion of manipulators and robots is often very complex and mathematically demand-
ing. A single coordinate frame usually isnâ€™t sufficient and its often convenient to use multiple
coordinate frames (fixed or moving) to make things easier.

**Terminology**\\
Fixed and World coordinate frames are used interchangeably and mean the same thing.\\
Mobile and Moving coordinate frames are used interchangeably and mean the same thing.

### What is a Coordinate Frame ?
If $p$ is a vector in $R^n$ and $X = {x^1 , x^2 , ...x^n}$ be a complete orthonormal set of $R^n$, then
coordinates of $p$ with respect to $X$ are denoted as $[p]^x$.\\

$$
\begin{aligned}
	p &= \Sigma{[p]_k^x}\hat{x^k} \\
	[p]_k^x &= p.x^k
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{align}
\sqrt{37} &= \sqrt{\frac{73^2-1}{12^2}} \\
 &= \sqrt{\frac{73^2}{12^2}\cdot\frac{73^2-1}{73^2}} \\ 
 & = \sqrt{\frac{73^2}{12^2}}\sqrt{\frac{73^2-1}{73^2}} \\
 & = \frac{73}{12}\sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{73^2}} \\ 
 & \approx \frac{73}{12}\left(1 - \frac{1}{2\cdot73^2}\right)
\end{align}
$$
