## Introduction

## Coordinate Transformation in 2D
The motion of manipulators and robots is often very complex and mathematically demand-
ing. A single coordinate frame usually isn’t sufficient and its often convenient to use multiple
coordinate frames (fixed or moving) to make things easier.

**Terminology**\\
Fixed and World coordinate frames are used interchangeably and mean the same thing.\\
Mobile and Moving coordinate frames are used interchangeably and mean the same thing.

### What is a Coordinate Frame ?
If $p$ is a vector in $R^n$ and $X = {x^1 , x^2 , ...x^n}$ be a complete orthonormal set of $R^n$, then
coordinates of $p$ with respect to $X$ are denoted as $[p]^x$.


$$
\begin{aligned}
	p &= \Sigma{[p]_k^x}\hat{x^k} \\
	[p]_k^x &= p.x^k
\end{aligned}
$$

### Translation
Assume a fixed frame $(O_0 − X_0 − Y_0 )$ and a mobile frame $(O_1 − X_1 − Y_1 )$. Let $C$ be a point
in space. The relation between both the frames and $C$ can be derived using simple math.

<!--Figure Needs-->

The following inferences can be made from the above figure:\\
Position of C $\mathit{wrt}$ frame $(O_0-X_0-Y_0)$ can be represented as 

$$
\begin{equation*}
	C^0 = \begin{bmatrix}
		X_C^0\\
		Y_C^0
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
$$

Position of C $\textit{wrt}$ frame $(O_1-X_1-Y_1)$ can be represented as  

$$
\begin{equation*}
	C^1 = \begin{bmatrix}
		X_C^1\\
		Y_C^1
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
$$

Position of $O_1$ $\textit{wrt}$ frame $(O_0-X_0-Y_0)$ can be represented as

$$ 
\begin{equation*}
	O_1^0 = \begin{bmatrix}
		X_0\\
		Y_0
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
$$

Position of $O_0$ $\textit{wrt}$ frame $(O_1-X_1-Y_1)$ can be represented as 

$$
\begin{equation*}
	O_0^1 = \begin{bmatrix}
		-X_0\\
		-Y_0
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
$$

### Rotation
Assume a fixed frame $(O_0-X_0-Y_0)$ and a mobile frame $(O_1-X_1-Y_1)$. Let C be a point in space. The relation between both the frames and C can be derived using simple math.

<!--Figure-->

The following equations can be written down based on the above figure 

$$\hat{X_1} = (X_1\cos{\theta})\hat{X_0} + (X_1\sin{\theta})\hat{Y_0} $$ 

$$\hat{Y_1} = - (Y_1\sin{\theta})\hat{X_0} + (Y_1\cos{\theta})\hat{Y_0} $$ 

Upon rearranging the terms,

$$
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\hat{X_1}\\
		\hat{Y_1}\\
	\end{bmatrix}
 = \begin{bmatrix}
 	\cos{\theta} & \sin{\theta}\\
 	-\sin{\theta} & \cos{\theta}\\
 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
	\hat{X_0}\\
	\hat{Y_0}\\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
$$

The above trigonometric matrix is called the rotation matrix, denoted by $R$. The relation between the coordinates of point C in the fixed and mobile frame can therefore be expressed as:
$$C^1 = R_0^1C^0$$
