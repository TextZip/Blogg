Hi, I'm **Jai**, a *final year undergrad* at *BITS Pilani*. I find myself constantly drawn towards projects that invlove a mix of electronics, programming and design. I document most of my projects here and also put up resources that I prepare/teach my juniors. 

I'm currently working as an undergraduate reseracher under the supervision of [Dr.Mitsuharu Morisawa](https://unit.aist.go.jp/jrl-22022/en/members/member-morisawa.html) at the [CNRS-AIST Joint Robotics Lab, IRL - Japan](https://unit.aist.go.jp/jrl-22022/index_en.html) exploring deep reinforcement learning based policies for quadruped locomotion and manipulation.

I am looking for a 2-year research intership position in the field of deep reinforcement learning and quadrupeds/legged robots. I'm available from September 2023. Please drop me mail if you know of any such opportunities.
